I am a PhD student at the [School of Information, University of Michigan](https://www.si.umich.edu/). My research interests broadly lie in behavioral economics and experimental economics. I run online, lab, and field experiments to understand how information shapes human decisions and behaviors.

I am co-advised by [Professor Yan Chen](https://yanchen.people.si.umich.edu/) and [Professor Alain Cohn](https://sites.google.com/site/alaincohn/home)

I completed my undergraduate study at the [School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
